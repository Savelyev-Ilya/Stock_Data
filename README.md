# Stock_Data

This is one of the assingment projects of the IBM Data Analyst professional certification.

I decided to post it here to demonstrate my python skills related to getting data from the web, loading it into pandas datarame, and manipulating it for the future data analysis.
I also made some visualisations that can be found inside of this project as .png files.
